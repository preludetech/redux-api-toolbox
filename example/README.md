This is a full stack application that will demonstrate all the good stuff.

Just search for #DOCS inside the codebase and you'll see some things we left for you to explain things :)

The best thing to do is to run each part of the full stack app in a separate terminal. See the internal readmes

You can also just take this example app and treat it as a template for your own application
